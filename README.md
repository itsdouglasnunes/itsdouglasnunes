### Hi there, I'm Doug 👋

  🚀 Technologist specialized in Multi-Cloud Architecture (Azure and AWS mostly), with background in Infrastructure (IT Infrastructure (Linux and Unix Operations), Networking and Security Architecture) with 20+ years of experience 

  🤝🏻 I'm always up for some nice discussion about technology over a good cup of coffee or a cold beer after business hours

  👯 Always eager to connect with other experts and collaborate

  🔭 I'm obsessed with microservices over K8s... AKS and EKS for now, with a bit of Openshift for on-premises to spice things up

  🌱 OpenAI, GPT4, Bard, Llama2... supporting, experimenting and loving to learn about it!
